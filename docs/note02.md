Of course. These strategic refinements are key to defining our unique market position. This update focuses on professionalizing the language, clarifying the capital efficiency of our model, and detailing the exciting Launchpad mechanics.

### Our Vision: Building the Complete Financial Stack on Bitcoin

TreeRoot is engineering the future of finance on Bitcoin, the world's most secure settlement layer. We are building a full-stack ecosystem of powerful, capital-efficient tools that serve everyone from individual traders to global merchants and innovative project founders. Our mission is to unlock the full potential of Bitcoin DeFi.

### The TreeRoot Product Ecosystem

Our platform is a suite of integrated solutions, each designed for a specific participant in the new Bitcoin economy.

#### For Individuals & Traders: The Self-Custodial Experience

Our non-custodial **Desktop Application** (and future Mobile App) provides a seamless and secure gateway to Bitcoin DeFi.

*   **Main DEX (AMM):** Instantly swap Taproot Assets through our primary Automated Market Maker, powered by community-provided liquidity pools.
*   **USDR Stablecoin:** Transact globally with USDR, our decentralized, Bitcoin-native stablecoin collateralized by a reserve of BTC and our ROOT token.
*   **Earn Yield:** Become a Liquidity Provider (LP) on our Main DEX by depositing your assets into liquidity pools to earn a share of the trading fees.

#### For Merchants: The Global Payment Gateway

We offer a managed, reliable payment solution for businesses to embrace the future of money.

*   **Accept USDR:** Seamlessly integrate our gateway to accept USDR payments from customers anywhere in the world.
*   **Managed Infrastructure:** We handle all technical complexity. Our managed nodes ensure perfect reliability for payment processing, allowing merchants to focus on their business.
*   **Simple Fees:** We charge a minimum of just $0.01 per transaction, making it one of the most affordable payment rails available. Standard charges for looping out to on-chain BTC apply.

#### For Innovators: The TreeRoot Launchpad

The Launchpad is the ultimate platform for the fair launch and price discovery of new ideas on Bitcoin.

*   **Instant Deployment & Liquidity:** Anyone can deploy a new token for a small issuance fee. Upon creation, the token is instantly placed into a liquidity pool paired against our wrapped Bitcoin (BTCR), enabling immediate buying, selling, and organic price discovery from the very first moment.
*   **Graduation to the Main DEX:** The Launchpad is a protected environment for new assets. Once a token's pool attracts a critical mass of liquidity—defined as 0.69 BTC worth of BTCR—it **graduates**.
*   **Post-Graduation:** Graduated pools are migrated to our Main DEX. This unlocks full functionality, allowing the wider community to become Liquidity Providers by adding *and* removing liquidity, transforming the project into a mature, fully-featured financial asset.

#### For Power Users & Developers: Capital-Efficient Infrastructure

*   **BTCR (Bitcoin on Root):** This is our cornerstone innovation for capital efficiency. BTCR is a wrapped version of Bitcoin that exists as a Taproot Asset. The primary method for wrapping and unwrapping is via secure on-chain transactions. This allows our entire ecosystem, including our super nodes, to operate with massive liquidity in BTCR, USDR, and ROOT while only needing small, Just-In-Time (JIT) Bitcoin channels for final settlement. This drastically reduces the capital costs associated with running a Lightning node.
*   **Free General-Purpose Token Issuance:** Outside the Launchpad, we continue to offer free token issuance for established projects and businesses.
*   **Submarine Swaps API:** Our API provides the critical infrastructure for looping between on-chain Bitcoin (L1) and all assets on our Lightning-powered layer (L2).

### Our Transparent Revenue Model

Our fees are simple, aligned with user success, and clearly defined across our product lines.

1.  **Main DEX Swap Fee (0.1% Platform Share):** A 0.5% fee is charged on all swaps in our main AMM. 80% of this (0.4%) goes to Liquidity Providers, with TreeRoot retaining 0.1%.
2.  **Launchpad Swap Fee (3%):** To support the high-growth environment of the Launchpad, a flat 3% fee is applied to all swaps within this specific ecosystem, payable in BTCR.
3.  **Launchpad Issuance Fee (1,000 sats):** We charge a flat 1,000 sats in BTCR to deploy a new project on the Launchpad.
4.  **BTCR Wrap/Unwrap Fee (0.01% or 100 sats):** We charge 0.01% of the value or a 100 sat minimum, whichever is higher, for wrapping BTC into BTCR or unwrapping it back to native L1 Bitcoin.
5.  **Submarine Swap & Looping Fee (1%):** Our advanced L1/L2 swap services carry a 1% fee on the transaction value, excluding on-chain network costs.
6.  **Merchant Payment Fee (Minimum $0.01):** Merchants are charged a minimum of one cent for each incoming payment they receive.
